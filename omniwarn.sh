Usage: $self <command> [arguments...]

Extreme hackjob to make a Docker image print warnings with (almost) any use.

Meant for deprecation warnings in images that are so old nobody should be using
them anymore but are getting downloads anyway. DON'T USE on images that are
actually important.

Works by replacing almost every single executable in the image with a wrapper
that prints a warning, then executes the original executable.

Example usage in Dockerfile, after writing your desired warning message into a
file named "warning":

  COPY omniwarn.sh warning ./
  RUN ./omniwarn.sh replace-all

Putting this at the end of your Dockerfile will build an image that prints your
warning message to stderr the first time any program is launched.
